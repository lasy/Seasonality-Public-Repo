abstract = {Background: Few studies have investigated international variations in the gestational age (GA) distribution of births. While preterm births (22-36 weeks GA) and early term births (37-38 weeks) are at greater risk of adverse health outcomes compared to full term births (39-40 weeks), it is not known if countries with high preterm birth rates also have high early term birth rates. We examined rate associations between preterm and early term births and mean term GA by mode of delivery onset. Methods: We used routine aggregate data on the GA distribution of singleton live births from up to 34 high-income countries/regions in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2010 to study preterm and early term births overall and by spontaneous or indicated onset. Pearson correlation coefficients were adjusted for clustering in time trend analyses. Results: Preterm and early term births ranged from 4.1{\%} to 8.2{\%} (median 5.5{\%}) and 15.6{\%} to 30.8{\%} (median 22.2{\%}) of live births in 2010, respectively. Countries with higher preterm birth rates in 2004-2010 had higher early term birth rates (r {\textgreater} 0.50, P {\textless} 0.01) and changes over time were strongly correlated overall (adjusted-r=0.55, P {\textless} 0.01) and by mode of onset. Conclusion: Positive associations between preterm and early term birth rates suggest that common risk factors could underpin shifts in the GA distribution. Targeting modifiable population risk factors for delivery before 39 weeks GA may provide a useful preterm birth prevention paradigm.},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTIONHow variable is the length of human pregnancy, and are early hormonal events related to gestational length?SUMMARY ANSWERAmong natural conceptions where the date of conception (ovulation) is known, the variation in pregnancy length spanned 37 days, even after excluding women with complications or preterm births.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYPrevious studies of length of gestation have either estimated gestational age by last menstrual period (LMP) or ultrasound (both imperfect measures) or included pregnancies conceived through assisted reproductive technology.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThe Early Pregnancy Study was a prospective cohort study (1982-85) that followed 130 singleton pregnancies from unassisted conception to birth, with detailed hormonal measurements through the conception cycle; 125 of these pregnancies were included in this analysis.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSWe calculated the length of gestation beginning at conception (ovulation) in 125 naturally conceived, singleton live births. Ovulation, implantation and corpus luteum (CL) rescue pattern were identified with urinary hormone measurements. We accounted for events that artificially shorten the natural length of gestation (Cesarean delivery or labor induction, i.e. 'censoring') using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazards models. We examined hormonal and other factors in relation to length of gestation. We did not have ultrasound information to compare with our gold standard measure.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEThe median time from ovulation to birth was 268 days (38 weeks, 2 days). Even after excluding six preterm births, the gestational length range was 37 days. The coefficient of variation was higher when measured by LMP (4.9{\%}) than by ovulation (3.7{\%}), reflecting the variability of time of ovulation. Conceptions that took longer to implant also took longer from implantation to delivery (P = 0.02). CL rescue pattern (reflecting ovarian response to implantation) was predictive (P = 0.006): pregnancies with a rapid progesterone rise were longer than those with delayed rise (a 12-day difference in the median gestational length). Mothers with longer gestations were older (P = 0.02), had longer pregnancies in other births (P {\textless} 0.0001) and were heavier at birth (P = 0.01). We did not see an association between the length of gestation and several factors that have been associated with gestational length in previous studies: body mass index, alcohol intake, parity or offspring sex.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONThe sample size was small and some exposures were rare, reducing power to detect weak associations.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSHuman gestational length varies considerably even when measured exactly (from ovulation). An individual woman's deliveries tend to occur at similar gestational ages. Events in the first 2 weeks after conception are predictive of subsequent pregnancy length, and may suggest pathways underlying the timing of delivery. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW In countries with comparable levels of development and healthcare systems, preterm birth rates vary markedly--a range from 5 to 10{\%} among live births in Europe. This review seeks to identify the most likely sources of heterogeneity in preterm birth rates, which could explain differences between European countries. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple risk factors impact on preterm birth. Recent studies reported on measurement issues, population characteristics, reproductive health policies as well as medical practices, including those related to subfertility treatments and indicated deliveries, which affect preterm birth rates and trends in high-income countries. We showed wide variation in population characteristics, including multiple pregnancies, maternal age, BMI, smoking, and percentage of migrants in European countries. SUMMARY Many potentially modifiable population factors (BMI, smoking, and environmental exposures) as well as health system factors (practices related to indicated preterm deliveries) play a role in determining preterm birth risk. More knowledge about how these factors contribute to low and stable preterm birth rates in some countries is needed for shaping future policy. It is also important to clarify the potential contribution of artifactual differences owing to measurement.},

abstract = {RESULTS: In 2010, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 6.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, and the United States ranked 26th in infant mortality among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. After excluding births at less than 24 weeks of gestation to ensure international comparability, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 4.2, still higher than for most European countries and about twice the rates for Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. U.S. infant mortality rates for very preterm infants (24-31 weeks of gestation) compared favorably with most European rates. However, the U.S. mortality rate for infants at 32-36 weeks was second-highest, and the rate for infants at 37 weeks of gestation or more was highest, among the countries studied. About 39{\%} of the United States' higher infant mortality rate when compared with that of Sweden was due to a higher percentage of preterm births, while 47{\%} was due to a higher infant mortality rate at 37 weeks of gestation or more. If the United States could reduce these two factors to Sweden's levels, the U.S. infant mortality rate would fall by 43{\%}, with nearly 7,300 infant deaths averted annually.
OBJECTIVES: This report investigates the reasons for the United States' high infant mortality rate when compared with European countries. Specifically, the report measures the impact on infant mortality differences of two major factors: the percentage of preterm births and gestational age-specific infant mortality rates.
METHODS: Infant mortality and preterm birth data are compared between the United States and European countries. The percent contribution of the two factors to infant mortality differences is computed using the Kitagawa method, with Sweden as the reference country.},

Countries with high preterm birth rates are more likely to have high early term birth rates; many risk factors are shared, including pregnancy complications (hypertension, diabetes), medical practices (provider-initiated delivery, assisted reproduction), maternal socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics and environmental factors. Exceptions include nulliparity and inflammation which increase risks for preterm, but not early term birth. Birth before 39 weeks GA is associated with adverse child health outcomes across a wide range of settings. International rate variations suggest that reductions in early delivery are achievable; implementation of best practice guidelines for obstetrical interventions and public health policies targeting population risk factors could contribute to prevention of both late preterm and early term births.},

abstract = {The Akaike (1973, 1974) information criterion, AIC, and the corrected Akaike information criterion (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989), AICc, were both designed as estimators of the expected Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the model generating the data and a fitted candidate model. AIC is justified in a very general framework, and as a result, offers a crude estimator of the expected discrepancy: one which exhibits a potentially high degree of negative bias in small-sample applications (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989). AICc corrects for this bias, but is less broadly applicable than AIC since its justification depends upon the form of the candidate model (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989, 1993; Hurvich et al., 1990; Bedrick and Tsai, 1994). Although AIC and AICc share the same objective, the derivations of the criteria proceed along very different lines, making it difficult to reconcile how AICc improves upon the approximations leading to AIC. To address this issue, we present a derivation which unifies the justifications of AIC and AICc in the linear regression framework.},

	abstract = {More than a century of ecological studies have demonstrated the importance of demography in shaping spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics. Surprisingly, the impact of seasonal recruitment on infectious disease systems has received much less attention. Here, we present data encompassing 78 years of monthly natality in the USA, and reveal pronounced seasonality in birth rates, with geographical and temporal variation in both the peak birth timing and amplitude. The timing of annual birth pulses followed a latitudinal gradient, with northern states exhibiting spring/summer peaks and southern states exhibiting autumn peaks, a pattern we also observed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the amplitude of United States birth seasonality was more than twofold greater in southern states versus those in the north. Next, we examined the dynamical impact of birth seasonality on childhood disease incidence, using a mechanistic model of measles. Birth seasonality was found to have the potential to alter the magnitude and periodicity of epidemics, with the effect dependent on both birth peak timing and amplitude. In a simulation study, we fitted an susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to simulated data, and demonstrated that ignoring birth seasonality can bias the estimation of critical epidemiological parameters. Finally, we carried out statistical inference using historical measles incidence data from New York City. Our analyses did not identify the predicted systematic biases in parameter estimates. This may be owing to the well-known frequency-locking between measles epidemics and seasonal transmission rates, or may arise from substantial uncertainty in multiple model parameters and estimation stochasticity.},

Clusters of days with higher birth numbers alternated with days with low numbers of births. Periodogram analysis revealed a significant periodicity of 6.98 days. The cosinor regression, testing 10 a priori supposed period lengths, found significant seasonality peaking in August-September and significantly highest birth numbers on Thursdays. Among the lunar and solar rotation cycles, the tropic lunar cycle and its 4th harmonic were most pronounced, in agreement with results concerning natality in Germany obtained by Svante Arrhenius in the 19th century. These findings confirm Derer-Halberg’s concept of multiseptans. In addition to cycling, a significantly increasing linear trend with a daily increase of 0.0045 births was encountered. This documents a growth of the population in agreement with national statistical data.},

The waveform of the annual rhythm is characteristic for geographical regions (e.g., unimodal or bimodal) and persists as such for many years. In most countries, the onset of \&alpha; coincides with \&mdealtxa; and lies close to the spring equinox. This phase of the rhythm is the most stable over time. In many populations, the rhythm has changed in recent years, specifically in amplitude and phase. The phase of the rhythm depends on latitude, with a 6-month difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The latitudinal distribution of amplitudes is less systematic. In spite of the many social influences on timing of conceptions, we conclude that the seasonal component in human reproduction is based on biological factors.},

Our results show for the first time on a global scale that photoperiod, as shown for many animals, may also influence the physiology of human reproduction. At higher latitudes, where changes in daylength are pronounced, a steep increase in human conceptions coincides with the vernal equinox. Temperature also appears to be a major influencing factor. Conception rates are above the annual mean at temperatures between 5\&deg; and 20\&deg;C, and temperature extremes decrease the probability of conceptions. In regions with cold winters and moderate summers, the number of conceptions correlates positively with temperature; close to the equator, where winters are more moderate than the hot summers, this correlation is negative. Regions with both hot summers and cold winters tend to have a bimodal conception rhythm. The influence of photoperiod is dominant before 1930, whereas the impact of temperature dominates in later years. With industrialization, people are increasingly shielded from both photoperiod (by indoor work) and temperature (by heating and air conditioning), which may explain the deseasonalization of the human conception rhythm. Photoperiod and temperature and the specific changes in their impact can account for several features of the annual human conception rhythm: latitude dependence, waveform, phase and amplitude, and their specific changes over time.},
